This allows you to do job searching in the comfort of your own home. This helps job seekers and businesses narrow down their potential employees and employees, respectively. Additionally, job seekers will be able to customise their profiles according to the market, which might assist employers locate specific applicants who meet their needs. To view the website online, all you need is a computer or mobile device with Internet connectivity. All Students and Employers must create an account and log in using their email and password to access our online career services portal. Students will build or edit their profiles, see job opportunities, and submit applications. Employers will manage their job postings and evaluate applicant materials. This system's login information is highly secure, and no one will be able to break it quickly. Students will be notified when they are summoned for an interview by employers and by employers when they apply to job offers. The primary user groups are as follows: 
1. Employer - register for an account, log in, browse candidates, add job offers, choose applicants who have already submitted an application for an interview, and monitor the post.
